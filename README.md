## How the game works :hammer:

Eat the slimes that are your size to become bigger, until you are king slime!

# What we changed from the A3 Design Document :scroll:

The following changes are what we have changed from our original A3 design:
- Added sound effects and background music, to give the game some life
- Slime Bits are now Slime Coins
- Added more small enemies, in order to improve gameplay
- Enemies now travel at a random speed within a defined range that changes every time they respawn
- When the player levels up, enemies will start to travel faster. As the player grows, the range of speeds that the enemies can have
increases. The world levels up with the player
- When the player levels up to the medium and large player sizes, there is chance that an enemy will drop a decrease speed power up when the player eats them
- Added a directional pointer to the player, indicating the direction that the player is travelling
- Added how to play screen to the main menu
vAdded game over screen detailing the number of points obtained in the game, and giving the user an option to start a new game or go back to the main menu
- The player now starts with 1 live, increasing the complexity of the game. It is now in the players best interest to collect hearts when they start a new game.
- Powerups in game will spin, adding some life to the gameplay
- Added text to indicate which powerup has been obtained, in order to give the user some information of what the powerup does
- Made the player invincible after respawning until they press a move key, in order to prevent them from spawning and dying instantly
- Added text to indicate the time until the player respawns
- Added text to indicate that the player is invincible
- When the player reaches 3 lives, hearts will yield 25 points instead of giving the player another life
