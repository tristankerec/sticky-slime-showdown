# Sticky Slime Showdown ðŸ¦ 

You know how sticky it gets!

## How to play :video_game:

In the menu screen, press the 'Start Game' button.

To move your character, use either:

``` 
W(up)
A(Left) 
S(Down)
D(Right)
```

or the Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys.

## How the game works :hammer:

Your character is the slime with the red circle underneath it.

Collect power ups to move faster, slower, gain another life, or get some SlimeCoins and Stars for some bonus points.

Eat the slimes that are the same size as you or smaller to gain points and level up your character, until you are king slime!
