# Sticky-Slime-Showdown

You know how sticky it gets!

## How to play :video_game:

In the menu screen, press the 'Start Game' button.

To move your character, use either:

``` 
W(up)
A(Left) 
S(Down)
D(Right)
```

or the Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys.

## How the game works :hammer:

Your character is the slime with the red circle underneath it.

Collect power ups to move faster, slower, gain another life, or get some SlimeCoins and Stars for some bonus points.

Eat the slimes that are your size to become bigger, until you are king slime!

# What we changed from the A3 Design Document :scroll:

Slime bits are now SlimeCoins

We made it so that not all enemies travel at the same speed and that instead it is a variable speed.
